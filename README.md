# StarWarsGame

![StarWars Logo]()
This is a game that asks if you want to play a character, movie, or planet quiz about the star wars world.
It is console-based, but I am hoping that I can move it over to processing and use graphics and sound. (image of thing after getting it)
I want the player to be able to start over after they finish a quiz.
I also want a limited amount of descriptions of the thing so that the user can lose.
I will include a win statement, start staement, and end statement.
Count the attempts and tell them how many times they had to try.
